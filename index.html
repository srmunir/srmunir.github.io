<p align="justify">I am an academic and data analyst doing research on domestic sources of foreign policy. I have previously served as an Assistant Professor in the Political Science stream in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) as well as the Department of Political Science at Forman Christian College University (FCCU). My research interests include asymmetric cooperation under the prospect of coercion from major powers, as well as opposition characteristics and their impact on external security arrangements in the Middle East.</p>
