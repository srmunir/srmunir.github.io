I am an Assistant Professor in the Political Science Department at Forman Christian College University (FCCU) in Lahore, Pakistan. My research interests include asymmetric cooperation under the prospect of coercion from major powers, as well as opposition characteristics and their impact on external security arrangements in the Middle East.
